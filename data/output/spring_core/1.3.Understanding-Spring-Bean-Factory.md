      content: "<h3 id=\"summary\">Summary</h3>\n<p>The concept of dependency injection that Spring is so popular for is possible because Spring behaves as a container of beans.</p>\n<p>You can have instances of your objects in the Spring container, which means that Spring handles the instantiation and the life cycle of the beans.</p>\n<p>Spring creates all instances of the objects you need. It also has references to all the objects. This is different from creating an instance yourself by using <code>new()</code>. This is what&#39;s called a <em>Factory pattern</em>.</p>\n<p>In the factory pattern, there exists an object that behaves as the <em>object factory</em>. Basically, whenever you need an instance of any object, you don&#39;t create the instance yourself. Instead, you call a method of this <em>factory</em> instance, and that method returns the instance you need. This <em>factory</em> might read from a configuration file, which acts as a blueprint, containing guidelines on how to create the object.</p>\n<p>Spring has objects of type <code>BeanFactory</code> which behave like an object factory. You specify object blueprints in a configuration file, an XML file, and supply it to the <code>BeanFactory</code>. Then when you need an instance of any object, you ask the <code>BeanFactory</code> for it. It then refers the XML file and constructs the bean as specified. This bean, which is now a <em>Spring bean</em> since it has been created by the Spring container, is then returned to whoever asked for it.</p>\n<p>In the next tutorial, we&#39;ll write code that implements this flow.</p>\n"
